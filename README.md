## IP Address
An IP address is used to uniquely identify your device on a network so that data can reach you correctly.  
It is also used for servers in data centers so you can access a website by knowing its IP address.

Since remembering IP addresses is difficult, domain names are used instead. This is where DNS helps.

## DNS
DNS works like a phonebook. When you enter a domain name, the browser sends a request to a DNS server to get the corresponding IP address.
